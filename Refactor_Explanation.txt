FizzBuzz:
Smells are : long method, comment.
Long method: ‘Say’ is a long method smell.
I have solved these smells by creating an Enum class named ‘Type’. I have finalized the values and checked them using a for each loop. 
Comment: Removed the comment as the code was readable.

PlaintextToHTMLConverter:
Smells are : comment, large class, long method, switch, duplicate code, and Hidden Dependencies code smell.
Comment: Removed the comments by modifying the methods. Comments were in line 60-61 and 68-69 and removed them as those methods were readable.
Long Method : made methods smaller by using enum and for each loop (i.e. basicHtmlEncode)
Switch case : Replaced all switch cases using the enum
Hidden Dependencies code smell : I removed global variables as they are undesirable because it directly causes the Hidden Dependencies code smell.
Duplicate code: Line 51 was a duplicated code, which I resolved using the for loop.
Deleted method ‘pushACharacterToTheOutput’ as that method wasn’t that much necessary. 


TriviaGame:
	Smells are : long method, switch case, large class,duplicate method
Defined the type of every list.
Long method: Used enum Category to refactor the long method and if-else ladder in ‘currentCategory’ method.
Other long methods are : penaltyBoxAction,add,roll,currentCategory, wasCorrectlyAnswered,wrongAnswer
There were some unnecessary methods.
